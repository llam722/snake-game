# Snake

## Summary

Snake is one of the [first video game genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). I created a browser based version using our understanding of OOP and DOM manipulation. TIt's a game, so have some fun!

## Demo

Quick "flash" game created from one of our units via pair programming creative ideas (we both played FPS games)
Our choice of "arrows" was W, A, S, D to represent up, left, down, right, respectively.

While we can certainly write tests for this unit, the more intuitive approach is to try playing the game by opening `index.html` in your browser.
